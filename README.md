#Running the project
1. Enter into project directory where package.json resides
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. npm run start OR nodemon or node bin/www
5. In browser hit http://localhost:5000 -- this is just a static page without API call
6. Hit http://localhost:5000/about -- this is with API call and renders the list of posts on page, I have uded an open API provided by JSON placeholder to print which returns list of posts, ie: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
